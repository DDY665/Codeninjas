Ganga Water Quality Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based application for predicting the water quality of the Ganga River. It leverages a Random Forest algorithm to analyze various parameters and provide predictions.

Features
Predicts water quality based on input parameters.
Built using Python and Flask for the backend.
Implements the Random Forest algorithm for accurate predictions.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.7)
pip (Python package manager)
